Wordsworth's focus on the beauty of nature and his ability to evoke deep emotions through vivid imagery has inspired me to explore similar themes in my own work. His lines from 'I Wandered Lonely as a Cloud,' where he describes the experience of seeing a daffodil field, have always touched me deeply. The way he captures the essence of that moment and conveys it through his words is truly masterful.\n\nAs for Whitman, his free-verse style and exploration of self-identity and human emotions have been incredibly influential in my own writing. His work, particularly 'Song of Myself,' has taught me to be more open and honest with my own feelings and experiences. Whitman's willingness to delve into the complexities of the human psyche has encouraged me to push the boundaries of conventional poetry and explore new ways of expressing myself through verse.\"\n\nCarlos Gomez then pauses for a moment, reflecting on his favorite poets before continuing, \"Their works have not only inspired my own writing but have also made me appreciate the power of words in conveying emotions, ideas, and experiences that are often difficult to put into words.
