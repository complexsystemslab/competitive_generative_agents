Applying mathematical patterns like the Fibonacci sequence and golden ratio can indeed enhance customer experiences.

Additionally, you could use the golden ratio when designing the layout of your cafe to create a sense of balance and proportion that subconsciously appeals to customers. The Fibonacci sequence can also be applied to the arrangement of tables or seating areas, allowing for optimal flow and spacing within the cafe. Overall, these mathematical patterns can contribute to an aesthetically pleasing and efficient environment for your customers."], ["Isabella Rodriguez", "That's really interesting, Tom!
